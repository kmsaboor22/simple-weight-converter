**Today’s Progress**: Thursday - I've decided to try to create markdown of projects I'd made either on my own or through tutorials.

**Thoughts:** 
1. I've seems to have trouble getting my picture to show up on my MD. 

2. Today I'm going to finish this tutorial. I know I'm most of way done with the video. I just need to finish the js. 
3. I might sperate the CSS and JS into different files. Just to make it easier for me to read.
